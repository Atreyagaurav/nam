CLI to rename your files based on the metadata or user inputs

Slowly building this. I think it'll be fun and usable, no need to rename files in the same templates again and again.

# TODO 
- [x] support user inputs
- [x] save user inputs for later reuse
- [ ] threshold for user inputs
- [x] Copy or Replace current file flag (destination directory for copy)
- [x] Batch Process
- [ ] Replace or countup flag for same name conflicts
- [ ] Single Keypress if possible for input
- [x] Add colors for different kind of input (choice+manual)
- [ ] support file metadata extration for variables
- [ ] compile for windows
